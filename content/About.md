### Short
I'm a UE5/C++ programmer with over five years of experience, primarily working in indie game studios like Dead Mage, NoOpArmy and CyberSoul which is a studio co-founded by my friends and I. I'm passionate about creating and problem-solving.

### Long
My journey into computer programming began eight years ago with web development. As I delved deeper into the field, I felt the need to transition to desktop programming, which led me to start learning C++ seven years ago. I initially picked up C++ through a Wrox programming book called "Professional C++." At the time, I lacked knowledge about computer architecture, hardware, and other essential aspects of software engineering. It was a period of learning syntax and grappling with the language itself.
Over the course of three years, during my high school years, I delved into C++, C#, and SQL Server to some extent. Eventually, I discovered my passion for game programming and, together with some friends, co-founded our own game studio called CyberSoul Studio. We started small, working out of my uncle's spare house and using Unity as our game engine.

During this time, we were particularly drawn to making games like Katana Zero and pixel art games in general. We dedicated ourselves to learning Unity, as well as the fundamentals of game development, team management, collaboration, mathematics, art, animation, and more. We also joined a growth center for game developers called HUB, located at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, where we expanded our network and learned about mobile game development. This led us to develop a game called Samurai Rush, an endless runner, which we published on a local Android store called Bazar.

As our interests shifted towards creating premium 3D PC games, we embarked on learning Unreal Engine, Maya, and other necessary tools. I focused on honing my C++ skills and delved into Unreal Engine 4. Over the course of three years, we continuously improved our skills, working on prototypes and exploring various aspects of game development. I personally delved into AI, procedural generation, UI, gameplay systems, soft skills like team management.

Realizing the importance of gaining experience in larger game studios, I joined Dead Mage Studio as a gameplay programmer, where I contributed to projects like Wizard of Legends 2 as a gameplay programmer. As a result of my university classes and works I couldn't be able to continue in Dead Mage as a full time programmer. Although my time at Dead Mage was short—only three months(the summer between my semesters)—it provided invaluable insights into working within larger teams and marked my first professional experience in the industry.

Towards the end of my tenure at Dead Mage, I embarked on developing my own AI framework for Unreal Engine 5, a long-time aspiration of mine. I collaborated with Ashkan Saeidi, the lead programmer and studio head of NoOpArmy, whom I had known for some time. Together, we worked on implementing a Utility AI system. While I focused on Unreal Engine implementation, Ashkan provided guidance based on his knowledge of Utility AI from books and discussions.
Eventually, I completed the project, learning a myriad of skills along the way—from tool programming and plugin development in Unreal to UI programming with Slate. I aimed to ensure that the plugin felt seamlessly integrated into Unreal Engine, and I'm proud to say that our efforts were recognized through positive reviews in the marketplace. It's incredibly gratifying to know that people appreciate the plugin, sometimes even more than the built-in Behavior Tree system.
Overall, I'm thrilled to have worked on an AI plugin that resonates with many users and contributes positively to their game development endeavors.
